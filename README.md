# Exploring the Relationship Between Fuel Consumption, Engine Displacement, and Performance Accessories in Automobiles


## Introduction

This is my final report for the multivariate course I took in my junior year, focusing on exploring which cars have lower fuel consumption and lower engine displacement using SAS. This project aids people to in better environmental awareness.

## Data Source
The mtcars dataset is a classic dataset available in R. It comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles. It can be accessed via the following link: https://gist.github.com/seankross/a412dfbd88b3db70b74b.
